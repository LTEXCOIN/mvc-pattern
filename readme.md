MVC Pattern is a very important for structure coding. Using _mvc_ a developer can easily handle class
object and also its property. Use of mvc reduce production time and also helps to ensure security as 
here public views and php directory are fully different. 
This is a microframework for starting journey with mvc. This will help you to learn mvc
frameworks such as **laravel**, **CI**, **Cakephp**, **Symphony** easily in future.
This is built using custom coding and will help you to understanding the functionlity. 

If you become benefitted using this for learning purpose please thumbs up and support me give start.
I always believe learning is a broad way for spreading knowledge.
